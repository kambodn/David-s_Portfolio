      <description>In a team we created and deployed a water catchment area management web application. This web app is capable of not only showing the latest test site compliances but also historical ones as well. In addition, it shows time series data on various test parameters with future forecast on overall compliance based on the SANS 241-1 water quality standard. I was in charge of the Geospatial data page showing the waste water treatment plants (WWTP) and the various river water test sites on an interactive folium map.</description>

      <description> Created and deployed a recommender system for movies on a Streamlit app. Built both a content-based filtering model based on movie content consumed and collaborative-based filtering model based on user similarity. </description>

      <description> Deployed a Streamlit app that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change based on their novel tweet data. Created a model that predicted tweet climate change sentiments with an accuracy of 90%. Utilized natural language processing to create features for the model. Presented our findings and app to an audience. Utilized Comet for version control. </description>

      <title>Project 3: Spain Electricity Shortfall Challenge</title>
      <link>https://github.com/kambodn/David-s_Portfolio.git/post/spain_electricity_shortfall_challenge/</link>

      <description>In a team we created a model that would help estimate the three-hourly load shortfall in Spain precisely and deployed it on an Amazon Ec2 instance. This information would aid the government in determining how much the shortfall in their power is expected to be and in turn guide infrastructure spending so as to ensure that the right budget is allocated for renewable energy generation and the investment in power infrastructure is channeled in the right direction.</description>
