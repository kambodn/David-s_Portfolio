I am a data scientist with background in Mathematics and Computer Science.
My passion is converting data into useful forms like dashboards, models and insights.
I just recently completed my internship where I was part of a team working on a GIS project for a waste water company and I'm currently working on a few projects to be later included in this portfolio.
