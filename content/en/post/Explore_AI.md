title: "Project 8: Water Catchment Area Management app"
---

- In a team we created and deployed a water catchment area management web application. 
- This web app is capable of not only showing the latest test site compliances but also historical ones as well. In addition, it shows time series data on various test parameters with future forecast on overall compliance based on the SANS 241-1 water quality standard.
- I was in charge of the Geospatial data page showing the waste water treatment plants (WWTP) and the various river water test sites on an interactive folium map.
- In this page one can view overall test site compliance information by year and quarter and can also drill down to any single site to view its compliance data. This also applies to the WWTP where information specific to them is shown. One can also filter to see only sites that failed in any available parameter of your choice.
