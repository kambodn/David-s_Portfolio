- In a team we created a model that would help estimate the three-hourly load shortfall in Spain precisely and deployed it on an Amazon Ec2 instance. This information would aid the government in determining how much the shortfall in their power is expected to be and in turn guide infrastructure spending so as to ensure that the right budget is allocated for renewable energy generation and the investment in power infrastructure is channeled in the right direction.
- Did a combination of non-graphical, graphical, univariate and multivariate exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
- Created new features and did some variable selection in terms of correlation and statistical significance.
- Tried out a few models and ended up settling on an ensemble which gave the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE).
- Presented our findings and app to an audience.
